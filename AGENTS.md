# Agent Instructions (gionx)

## Language

- Respond in Japanese, concisely and politely.

## Asking Questions

When asking the user to make a decision:

- Provide 2-3 concrete options.
- For each option, explicitly state trade-offs (pros/cons, risks, impact on UX/complexity/maintenance).
- Then ask the user to pick (e.g. by number).

Avoid asking with options only (no trade-offs).
